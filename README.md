<p align="center">
    <img alt="Main cover React Movie App"  src="./images/i1.png"/>
</p>

This project cosists of a **React** app ‚öõÔ∏è Which has as a theme, *The Movie Database API*
and displays a list of popular movies üé• and information about each individual movie. The
information is displayed in a new page after clicking on the poster, from the grid, 
corresponding to that specific movie. The app makes the use of modern 
**Functional components** and **React hooks**, and it uses **styled components** üíÖ 
for handling the styles. The project uses the **React Context API** for storing the 
user in a global state accessible for all the components that are part of the created 
context. The application also uses the **React Router** for managing the routes inside of
the application. The project is deployed on **Netlify**, and it integrates a **CI/CD** 
pipeline for automatic inegration and automatic deployment to Netlify for ease of 
development. The deployment checks run when creating a pull requestor when commiting 
directly to the *main* branch. The project contains a branch called *class-components* 
which represents, as the name suggests, a version of the project written with the 
*"classical"* **React class-components**.

# CI/CD

In the beginning the first deployment was unsuccesful due to an error 

![GitHub Pull Requests](/images/c.png)

![Deploy log](/images/c0.png)

![Login #1](/images/c1.png)

The error was caused by an un-used variable and it was fixed using an `eslint no-used-vars` comment rule

After the fix all the checks from the automatic deployment on Netlify have passed and the site went live

![Update Login.js #2](/images/c2.png)

Now when creating a pull request on the main branch or when commiting directly on the main branch,
 the automatic deployment rules execute and run the checks for the new build.
